Iterators

> WHy create an iterator

- you are writing a program where you need the next item in a list, where the data struture does not allow you to gain access to the index.
- you cannot use a for loop or a for each loop for an iterator
- iterators also do not throw exceptions when you add/remove elements from the data structure
