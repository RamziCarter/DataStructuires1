> Implementing a stack

* You can implement using a
* linked list
* array
* vector
 * a built in data structure that java provides
 * main differences
  * an array list is not thread safe, but a vector is
  * Resizing
   * an arrayList hrows by adding half its size
   * a vector grows by doubling its size; You can choose this for a vextor
* How can you choose between the three data structures????
