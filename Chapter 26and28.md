* a balanced binary tree is the best tree to search
* "Spreading out" nodes shortens search times
   * when adding a node it has to go into the correct spot
   * which may cause the tree to become unbalanced
   * deleting a node can also cause the tree to become unbalnced
    * if a tree becomes unbalanced we must balance it again
