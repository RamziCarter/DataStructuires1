## Chapter 3

```
> Linked Lists 

* nodes - hold data 
* each node has a pointer (link) to the next node, therefore they are linked together
   * null indicated there is nothing there
* One field in the class definition is the name of the class 

* There isn't a physical linked list inside the program
  * It lives in memory
  * There is a pointer to the first node in the list 
  
* to print items in a linked list you need to traverse the list
  * different from arrays where you would create a for loop
