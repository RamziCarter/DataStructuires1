#### Chapter 4

## efficiency of algorithms

* The speed of an algforithm
   * Objective
      * Sort data in an array
      * which sorting algorithm do you choose?
      * You want the fastest algorithm?
      * How can you compare the algorithms?
   * Comparing Algorithms
      * set a timer
      * use this timer to test the amount of time from when the program is initiated until the output is produced
      * This is UNRELIABLE
        * when programs are competing with other progrms this can slow down compile time\
        * Background processes can also slow down program execution 
   * There are two ways to measure algorithm efficiency
      * Time the algorithm requires
        * time complexity   
      * Memory the algorithm requires
        * space complexity 
      * Meaasuring either is called the analysis of an algorithm
   * Both time and space complexity are based on the problem size
      * Problem size mean the number of items (INPUT)
      * Since measuring time is not reliable we understand the time complexity by counting operations 
* Time Complexity of loops
   *  timing the code requires accounting for loop overhead
